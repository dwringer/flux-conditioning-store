description: Use SQLite to store and retrieve FLUX conditionings
keywords: [node, invokeai, python, stablediffusion]
requirements:
  - invokeai>=4
intro: |
  This is a pair of nodes for taking FLUX Conditioning objects - specifically, prompt embeddings (consisting of T5 and CLIP embedding tensors) - and storing/retrieving them with an SQLite database file. This avoids the overhead of having to encode the conditioning somehow in image metadata, with the disadvantage of being non-portable.

  The database is stored in a file, `flux\_conditionings.db`, right alongside the source code of this node. In the `store\_flux\_conditioning.py` file, there are configurable variables to set the maximum DB size and warning thresholds, after which the oldest entries will be automatically deleted. Therefore, if you expect to need them for a while, make sure to increase the size limit.

  ### Installation:

  To install these nodes, simply place the folder containing this
  repository's code (or just clone the repository yourself) into your
  `invokeai/nodes` folder.
